## Installation Instructions
The current installation instructions have been tested against an
empty Anaconda Python environment, with `python3.7`.

### Download HeidelTime Standalone
The current releases can be found [here](https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime/releases).
We further require the [`python_heideltime`](https://github.com/PhilipEHausner/python_heideltime) wrapper,
which also details the installation instructions in a similar manner.

Do not forget to set the corresponding path's in `python_heideltime`'s
configuration file, as well as the config file in this repository.

Install requirements in `requirements.txt`.

Additionally add nltk.stopwords

and spacy language models
